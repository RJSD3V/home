      <h1>I talked about Data, and people listened.</h1>
      <img class="article-img" src="./assets/images/Feb 22, 2024 DE SYD Meetup .png"/>
      <p>I spoke at a data engineering meetup about my personal project.I don't know how it happened. I had an Idea to build an end-to-end pipeline in duckdb and dbt with a dashboard in streamlit. I wanted to work in climate data and this seemed like a good Idea to apply my data-modelling experience in a use-case I care about.
         It's like a starter pack for my Climatology analysis. While building the project, I was approached by someone in the DataEngBytes team, to see if I wanted to talk about my work. I didn't have much to say about my experience as a freelancer, but no one was stopping me from talking about my backyard hobby-shop projects
         I build to occasionaly remind myself that Im not a total idiot without a manager. For someone who's been working remotely for 4 years (and counting), It was the first time I was speaking publicly (in person) to a crowd of people who were'nt paying me money to do my job.
         I sort of felt the weight of expectations to not just give a quality presentation and add value but to also not put the audience to sleep. It was nerve racking, but I found a new platform where I can share my work. It inspires me to build more stuff with new tools and techniques to understand what works and what doesn't. This was my first talk in a meetup and it was the most rewarding experience Ive had, sharing my data projects with a crowd and getting feedback.

      <hr>
      <p>Every Final Year College project is a pain in the ass. Especially for technical courses.
         For me, a computer science major didn’t offer a lot of lucrative options. We got to chose between Java , .Net and Android. Since, I’ve been well versed with Java since the 8th grade, I figured maybe I could give it a go...</p>
