        <p>A while back I decided to update my portfolio. Now being a Data Engineer I was pretty stumped considering most of the work I did was on the cloud in a client owned data warehouse. So I had no clue what to make. I could make one of those end-to-end docker image processes with python scripts scrapping data, but I sort of wanted to interact more with an OLAP database, since that's what I've been working with for the past few years.
