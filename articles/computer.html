        <h1 >Im building my own computer</h1>
        <p>For 5 odd years, I have had narrow stints of building stuff from scratch. Including apps and small games for marketing AR demos, I developed the spark for building stuff from nothing. 
            But for the majority of my career, Ive been a Data engineer. That just involves writing a tonne of SQL models and building specific dashboards for stakeholders trying to make decisions on 
            regarding revenue, metrics and other marketing scores.</p>
            <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/course">Here's the link to the course</a>
            <h2> Breakdown</h2>
            <p>Remember Nand2Tetris? A group of brilliant scientists designed this course to help developers like me understand better how computers work
            from the ground up. They also wrote a book, called Elements of Computing, which I will be exploring among other material in this 6-8 part section of my website. 
            I've always wanted to at least understand how a computer works, if not build one for myself, But having the oppurtunity and the right resource to do the same, 
          and having studied Von Neumann's model in university has always kept me curious about the question:
              <blockquote>"Can I build My own computer from scratch?"</blockquote>
            
              <em>Im using the nand2tetris as a reference, and I intend to find the time and do the exercises and projects given within the context of the book, 
              alongside my full time job. Which is why this section of my website might seem unfinished and messy at times.</em>

            <h2> Boolean Logic & Arithmetic </h2>
          
            <p>
            I am working on understanding and implementing the fundamentals of Boolean logic. This takes me back 
            to my Uni days. Truth tables and evaluating boolean expressions was like the norm at the time. Doing a "minor" in Phsyics
            these truth tables and boolean logic came in handy while creating digital circuits on bread-boards in order to light up LED's and make adders, multiplexers,
            and convert analog signals to digital.

      <h2>How I turned my college project into a lifelong passion.</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Every Final Year College project is a pain in the ass. Especially for technical courses.
         For me, a computer science major didn’t offer a lot of lucrative options. We got to chose between Java , .Net and Android. Since, I’ve been well versed with Java since the 8th grade, I figured maybe I could give it a go...</p>
