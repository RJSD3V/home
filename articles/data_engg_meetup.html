            <p>I spoke at a data engineering meetup about my personal project.I had an Idea to build an end-to-end pipeline in duckdb and dbt with a dashboard in streamlit. I wanted to work in climate data and this seemed like a good Idea to apply my data-modelling experience in a use-case I care about.
                It's like a starter pack for my Climatology analysis. While building the project, I was approached by someone in the <span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dataengbytes/">#DataEngBytes</a></span> team, to see if I wanted to talk about my work. I didn't have much to say about my experience as a freelancer, but no one was stopping me from talking about my backyard hobby-shop projects
                I build to occasionaly remind myself that Im not a total idiot without a manager. For someone who's been working remotely for 4 years (and counting), It was the first time I was speaking publicly (in person) to a crowd of people who were'nt paying me money to do my job.
                I sort of felt the weight of expectations to not just give a quality presentation and add value but to also not put the audience to sleep. It was nerve racking, but hey, This was a new platform where I can share my work.This wasn't a test or a performance review. It was an oppurtunity I could use to tell a story through data.
                It has inspired me to work further on my climateology analysis and build more stuff with new tools and techniques to understand what works and what doesn't. Seth Godin was write. This is making and sharing art. This was my first talk in a meetup and it was the most rewarding experience Ive had, sharing my data projects with an audience free of judgement and getting feedback that nurtures not only my project,
                but also helps me grow as an engineer.</p>
