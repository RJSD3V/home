    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Ive worn many hats over the years as a software professional. The majority of my work profile has been in Data Teams working on Data Applications, APIs and machine learning models.
      These roles covered various domains, including Marketing, Fashion (Value Chain), Mobile Apps and Logistics. Here I was responsible for builing end to end data infrastructure pipelines, which included backend development, 
      building dashboards, Machine Learning models, and for a short time building Product MVPs and Augmented Reality Games for Android. I have a fair understanding of the Software Development Life cycle. 
      I built this website from scratch using nothing but html and CSS.

                    really in trend. I started experimenting with complex Unity Android concepts like pulling 3D assets from the cloud using addressables on demand and several Augmented reality features
                    to deliver live customized experiences to customers of our client businesses as marketing push notifications.

            <li><p>This was my first job straight out of college. I started doing data file archiving for clients that had a huge unstructured data "mess" ranging from xml files on ftp 
              servers to basically having a lot of "undocumented" data consisting of hard copy files and slip like invoices. My first task was to understand what was filed where and basically
              make entries from created files to archiving them in ftp servers in a drag and drop fashion.

            <li>
                <p>
                   I started off using talend as I was well versed in Java and JDBC, connected to a snowflake backend where we helped our client (a logistics company) migrate to snowflake and aws as their
                   new data infrastrucutre. This included creating automated jobs that pulled data from a lot of sources , processed them in different talend components and pushed the results to a well designed snowflake 
                   data infrastructure designed based on the logical structure of the company.
